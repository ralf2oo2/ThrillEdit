# ThrillEdit
Tool for editing parts of ThrillVille: Off The Rails, it currently only supports replacing audio though <br/>

## Usage
Once you start the application for the first time you need to select the ThrillVille root directory. After selecting the root directory you get to see the main menu. On the left you can see a filetree of certain files in the directory. Double click any of the files to open them. When the application detects vorbis files in the opened files it will display the audio player. Right clicking any songs in the song list there will give you the option to replace it or export it.

I probably wouldn't have figured out how to detect vorbis files without this and in general it was a very useful tool for debugging
